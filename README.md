* Case Study
The Thrive Beverage Company (TBC) is a niche, 
family owned beverage distributor that wholesales various beverage 
products from regional suppliers. 

As TBC grows, the business intelligence and reporting systems cannot keep up. 
Under the direction of the CIO,  the Director of Analytics and AI forms a task force of internal data architects, 
business analysts, and purchasing buyers to select a No-Limits Analytics solution: Incorta.

In this case study project, as a business analyst, we can help TBC generate new profitability insights using Incorta.
